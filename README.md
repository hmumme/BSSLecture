#### Part B
Matlab calculation:

![Alt text](/problem1/hw11-problem1b.png?raw=true "Matlab Calculation")

The matlab calculated eigenvalues are almost exactly equal to my calculated eigenvalues. The matlab calculated eigenvectors are in the same ratio as my calculated vectors. 

For example, v1 = (0.2989,-0.9571) in matlab and this ratio (v1,1 / v1,2) is equal to -0.3123 ... my calculated eigenvector is (-0.303,1) and this ratio is -0.303 .
